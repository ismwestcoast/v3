Pianorama is a programme offered by the International School of Music.  It integrates the learning of the piano/keyboard simultaneously with musicianship skills.

In a 45 minute weekly lesson during school terms, the students cover the following:

- Piano/keyboard tuition - studying all styles of music with solo and ensemble experience;
- Singing - to develop pitch and aural;
- Percussion - to develop rhythmic skills;
- Theory/ Musical games - for confirmation of reading notation and musical elements;
- Music Appreciation - understanding of musical structure and creativity.

Our classes have a maximum of 10 students, grouped according to age.  Each student is provided with a digital piano for use in the classroom.

Our aim is for students to be creative and have fun in a lively class atmosphere, while developing traditional piano technique.

Students must have a piano/digital piano/keyboard for home practice.
