This is for Junior Course graduates, to further expand musical and technical skills acquired thus far.  The students learn to become more musically independent and work at a more comprehensive level.  The course covers repertoire, technique development, solfege aural concepts, harmonic extension, theory worksheets and ensemble and individual practical work.
