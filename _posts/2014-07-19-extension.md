Extension Course is for Primary and Intermediate Course graduates.  All musical styles or repertoire with a technical development programme are covered at this level.  This, together with the acquired musical awareness, enables the teacher to work with the students in composition, improvisation, keyboard harmony and theoretical worksheets.  Students cover the AMEB theory syllabus and have the option to present for the AMEB examinations if appropriate.
