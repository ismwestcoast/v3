                    The International School of Music Westcoast provides unique group music programs for children from 2 years of age. Nurturing a love and appreciation of music, with an emphasis on creativity and performance, the stimulating classroom environment focuses
                    on developing music fundamentals.
            </p>
            <p>
                    ISM Westcoast's aim is to teach music as a language. The instruction is aurally based to maximise learning in young students, encouraging not only a love of music, but an understanding of music.
            </p>
            <p>
                    The concept of ISM courses is simple:
            </p>
            what you hear, you sing; what you sing, you play; what you play, you read; what you read, you write.
            <p>
                    ISM Westcoast currently runs pre-school music classes and piano classes 6 days a week at our two school locations - Wembley and Carine Glades. All of our pre-school and group piano classes are written specifically for children by Rosalind Thrift, a well
                    respected Australian music educator. All programs are supported by speed variable disks and have been carefully structured to give the maximum benefit to each student, developing all technical and musical components, whilst still being fun and
                    exciting.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Individual piano lessons are available to Pianorama graduates as well as group theory classes. AMEB exams in Piano and Theory are available to Extension graduates.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Our teachers are highly experienced, fully qualified teachers who are also ISM accredited.
